# SWMapster32
Shadow Warrior Map Editor Port
==============================

 * This Release 1.0: 22 October 2017


This is a work-in-progress release of SWMapster32 using Duke3D map editor port Mapster32 as a codebase. 
There are bugs which I'm tracking down and fixing as an ongoing process.

Warnings
--------
 1. Since this is work-in-progress I cannot and will not attest to the safety
    of using this executable. You use it at your own risk!
 2. 3D Realms and Apogee do not support this port.
 
Enjoy!
